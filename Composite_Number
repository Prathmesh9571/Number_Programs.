/* In mathematics, numbers that contain more than two factors are called Composite numbers, or A number that can be produced by multiplying two smallest positive integers and should have at least one divisor apart from 1 and itself. The number always contains more than two factors.   It contains more than two factors
-They are evenly divisible by the factors
-4 is the smallest composite number
-Each Composite number is the factor of itself
-The composite number will contain at least two prime numbers as their factors*/
